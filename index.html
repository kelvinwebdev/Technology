                innovation and disruption is here. Or, more accurately,
                according to Josh Bersin, “The future of work is already here.”
                So yes, the robots are coming. These robots aren’t physical
                machines; they’re software “bots” installed on desktop computers
                or in the cloud that can be configured to automate increasingly
                complex tasks, such as moving, manipulating, and validating
                data.

                what's next to come, say, for example, in 2020. One of those who
                like to contemplate about the future of technology is French
                designer Josselin Zaigouche who decided to design this
                incredible gadget, dubbed Apple Black Hole (and it's not because
                it will such Apple down if it hits the market). The name was
                probably inspired by the numerous applications one can find in
                Apple's device (such as iPhone and iPad).
